## Hardware Overview
Curiosity features a robust hardware setup designed for versatility and performance in the FTC competition. It consists of the following components:

* 8 Servos (35 kg) for various mechanisms, including gripper, shooting mechanism, and arm.
* 12 Rev DC Motors: 4 for driving the robot, 4 for hanging and Intake, 4 for extension mechanism.
* Chassis with 4 Maccanum Wheels which helped a bot to strafe and go sideways.
* Mechanisms include a gripper for grabbing game elements (pixels), a shooting mechanism for endgame tasks, and an arm.

## Software Architecture
The software architecture of Curiosity is built using Java programming language within Android Studio IDE. The architecture encompasses different modules and functions to control various aspects of the robot's operation, including movement, mechanism control, autonomous sequences, and teleoperated mode interactions.

## Programming Techniques
Curiosity's programming approach is Command-based, emphasizing modularity and efficiency. Key programming techniques include:
* Creation of reusable functions to orchestrate sequences of intake and outtake.
* Development of autonomous sequences meticulously tested over 100 times to ensure smooth robot operation during competitions.
* Creating subSystems for the modularity and flexibility of code.

## Operational Capabilities
Curiosity demonstrates impressive operational capabilities tailored to meet the challenges of the FTC Goa Robot Competition 2024:

* Precise movement facilitated by traction and omni wheels.
* Effective grabbing and manipulation of game elements using servo-controlled gripper.
* Accurate shooting of drones during endgame tasks with the dedicated servo mechanism.
* Smooth integration of intake and outtake mechanisms for efficient gameplay.

## Achievements
Achieved 4th rank in the competition, demonstrating competitive prowess and strategic gameplay.

## Conclusion
Thank you for exploring the documentation for Curiosity, our robot for the FTC Goa Robot Competition 2024. We hope this resource provides valuable insights into our design, programming, and performance, inspiring future innovations in the FTC community.
